Arrays
//An array is an ordered collection of data. Compared to a variable, 
//that can only store one value, arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. 

//Each item in an array has a number attached to it called the numeric index which can be accessed.
// In Javascript arrays start at indecx zero and can be manipulated by various methods.

        var carBrands = ["honda", "mitsubishi", "bmw"];
        var numbers = [1, 3, 4, 3];
