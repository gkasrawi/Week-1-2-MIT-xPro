Objects        
//One of Javascripts data types an object is used to store various collections and more complex data entities using keys/value pairs. 
// In a key Value pair, the first data entity is called the key and the second is called the value. For example in the key.value pair [ name: Steve]
// the key is "name", and the value is "Steve". Anything can be stored in a key value pair; arrays numbers, strings, to even other objects.

    var dreamCar = {
brand: "Audi";
Model: "A6"
Cylinders: 6
}

// the keys in the dreamCar objects are brand, model, cylinder. What values do each key point do?
