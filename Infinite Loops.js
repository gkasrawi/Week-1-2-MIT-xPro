Infinite Loops

    // An infinite loop is a loop that never ends, because a certain condition always evaluates to true.
    // An infinite loop is a set instruction sequence that loops endlessly when a terminating condition isnt met. 
        var counter = 0;
        do {
            console.log("I'm struck!"}; // logging to console if condition is met. 
            while (counter < 10);       // terminating condition declared 

    State        
    //State is the status particular object or piece of data which can change (for example based on time or location).
    //For an object to be stateful, it needs to have the ability to remember its previous status.
